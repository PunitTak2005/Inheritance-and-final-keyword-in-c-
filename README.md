# Inheritance-and-final-keyword-in-c-
In C++, inheritance allows a class (derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (base class), promoting code reuse. The `final` keyword, when applied to a class, prevents further inheritance, while when used with a function, it prevents that function from being overridden in derived classes.
